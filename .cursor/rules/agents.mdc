# AI Agent Rules Overview

This project uses specialized rule files for different aspects of development. Each rule file is focused on a specific domain to provide clear, maintainable guidance.

# When user asks to scaffold or extend a .NET console app:
- Always propose a PLAN before writing code.
- Plans must include: solution layout, file paths, NuGet packages, CLI flags, test plan, coverage gate, CI workflow.
- Each step should show either: exact shell commands OR a unified diff for each file.

## Rule File Structure

### Core Development Rules
- **dotnet-development.mdc**: General .NET coding standards, conventions, and best practices
- **configuration-management.mdc**: Configuration and environment management rules

### Process and Integration Rules  
- **workflow-standards.mdc**: Git workflow, task completion, and build verification standards
- **mcp-integration.mdc**: MCP server configuration and usage guidelines
- **search-behavior.mdc**: Search result processing and analysis protocols

## Core Principles
- Follow .NET best practices and conventions
- Use event sourcing with Marten for test log processing
- Implement comprehensive testing strategies
- Maintain clean, maintainable code architecture
- Use task-based development with proper Git workflow
- Trust project-specific configuration over generic solutions

## Quick Reference
- **Build Verification**: Always run `dotnet build` before merging
- **Search Results**: Always analyze search results before concluding information is missing
- **MCP Tools**: Prefer MCP tools over manual instructions when available

For detailed rules in each domain, refer to the specific rule files listed above.
