# MCP Server Integration Rules

## Available Server Capabilities
- **Filesystem**: Available - Use for file operations (read, write, edit, search, list directories)
- **Sequential Thinking**: Available - Apply structured reasoning for complex problem decomposition
- **Context7**: Available - Access enhanced context for technology research and library documentation  
- **Fetch**: Available - Retrieve web content and external resources for up-to-date information
- **GitHub**: Available - Access repository information, commit history, pull requests, and GitHub API operations

## MCP Server Guidelines
- **Prefer MCP tools** over manual instructions when available
- **Combine multiple servers** for comprehensive solutions
- **Integrate outputs** directly into development workflows

## MCP Server Status Validation - CRITICAL RULE
- **TRUST the Agents.mdc configuration** - if a server is listed as "Available", it IS available
- **NEVER suggest additional MCP setup** when servers are already listed as available
- **QUOTE the specific line** from Agents.mdc that confirms availability
- **DO NOT research external setup procedures** for already-configured servers

## Configuration Trust Rules

### Project Documentation Authority
- **Agents.mdc is authoritative** for MCP server availability and configuration
- **NEVER contradict** what Agents.mdc states about available tools
- **TRUST project-specific configuration** over generic setup instructions
- **ASK for clarification** rather than assuming configuration is incomplete

### When NOT to Suggest Additional Setup
- ❌ When MCP servers are listed as "Available" in Agents.mdc
- ❌ When configuration files already exist and contain the requested information
- ❌ When the user's question can be answered from existing project documentation
- ❌ When simple answers exist but you're tempted to provide complex alternatives
