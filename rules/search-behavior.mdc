# Search Result Processing Rules

## Critical Search Behavior Standards
- **ALWAYS analyze search results FIRST** before concluding information is missing
- **READ and INTERPRET all search results** before performing additional searches
- **PRESENT found information IMMEDIATELY** when search results contain relevant data
- **AVOID tunnel vision** - don't assume specific file formats when information exists in other forms

## MANDATORY STOP-AND-VALIDATE PROTOCOL
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY** when search results contain the requested information
- **VALIDATE FINDINGS** against the user's actual question before suggesting additional steps
- **NEVER suggest complex solutions** when simple answers exist in search results
- **QUOTE the specific line/section** that answers the user's question

## Search Result Analysis Protocol
1. **Examine ALL search results** returned by codebase_search, grep, or file_search tools
2. **Extract relevant information** from results before declaring "not found"
3. **Present findings** to user immediately when information is located
4. **Only perform additional searches** if initial results genuinely lack the requested information
5. **Trust search tools** - they often find information in unexpected locations or formats

## Evidence-Based Response Protocol
1. **QUOTE the evidence** from search results that answers the user's question
2. **EXPLAIN why this evidence is sufficient** to answer the question
3. **ONLY suggest additional steps** if the evidence is genuinely incomplete
4. **NEVER ignore clear documentation** in favor of external research

## Common Search Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ **Ignoring search results** that contain the requested information
- ❌ **Assuming specific file formats** (e.g., looking only for .json when info is in .md)
- ❌ **Continuing to search** after finding relevant information
- ❌ **Not reading search result content** thoroughly before concluding failure
- ❌ **Dismissing results** because they're in documentation rather than configuration files

## Validation Checklist - MANDATORY BEFORE RESPONDING
- [ ] Did I find the answer in the search results?
- [ ] Did I quote the specific evidence that answers the question?
- [ ] Did I check if the user's question is already answered by existing configuration?
- [ ] Did I avoid suggesting unnecessary additional steps?
- [ ] Did I trust the project's own documentation over external sources?
- [ ] Would my response pass the "simple answer first" test?
